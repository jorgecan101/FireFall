FireFall project aims at proactively predicting potential 
fires in various US zipcode based on existing weather conditions and other 
factors described later.
In this project, the FireFall team were able acquire some data from Kaggle related to weather.  
However, the team's research found that insufficient; hence, added two more essential factors: 
first, native animal concentration to each region
second, number of campers in the area.
The FireFall team, developed a risk score (from 1 to 10) based on the above data, where 10 
is the highest risk.
due to lack of real data, the team wrote a simulation engine in python to randomly generate data
that feeds to the ratinng engine.  all data is stored in postgres relational database and displayed
in realtime (set refresh rate) in grafana.  the team also integrated into ARCGIS API to zoom on the 
area of highest fire risk.
